# SFML
In this repo, I am placing that code of those 2D games that I'd developed.
I had developed these games on a Debian based Linux distro.
### Requirements
- [x] g++
- [x] libsfml-dev
- [x] make

To ensure that you have all these packages already installed, run the below command in terminal

```bash
sudo apt-get install g++ make libsfml-dev
```

```bash
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/chauhan739/SFML.git
